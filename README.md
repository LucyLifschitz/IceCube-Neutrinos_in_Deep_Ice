# IceCube-Neutrinos_in_Deep_Ice


This notebook is based on work done for Kaggle competition IceCube - Neutrinos in Deep Ice. 
The goal of the competition is to predict a neutrino particleâ€™s direction. One was tasked with 
development of a model based on data from the "IceCube" detector, which observes the cosmos 
from deep within the South Pole ice.

This work could help scientists better understand exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic 
phenomena involving black holes, neutron stars and the fundamental properties of the neutrino itself.
